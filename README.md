**Introduction**:

As urban areas continue to evolve and transform, understanding patterns of foot traffic within commercial zones is integral to supporting the growth and vitality of businesses. This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of foot traffic across various businesses situated on commercial corridors within the South St. Petersburg Community Redevelopment Area. Harnessing data from the City of St. Petersburg's Business Tax ID records for the year 2023, the study delves into categorizing businesses based on the volume of walk-ins they experience.

**Implications for Stakeholders**:

Recognizing which sectors receive high foot traffic and understanding potential areas of growth can lead to proactive policies that ensure robust commercial ecosystems.
 
2. **Entrepreneurs**: As businesses continuously face the challenges of an ever-changing market landscape, the data from this study can prove invaluable. Entrepreneurs can gain insights into which areas receive high foot traffic, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding expansion, product/service offerings, and strategizing against potential challenges.

3. **Investors and Financiers**: Investment decisions are often ridden with uncertainty. However, with this foot traffic data in hand, investors can confidently direct their funds into businesses or areas within the commercial corridor that showcase promising foot traffic trends.

**Project Aim**:

In essence, this analysis seeks not only to unveil patterns in foot traffic but to play a pivotal role in the economic rejuvenation and development of the South St. Petersburg area.
